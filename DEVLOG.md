## Patrick Was

### 2025-01-06 - Basic files, skeleton

**~35 minutes:** Editing README.md, DEVLOG.md, and PROPOSAL.md. README.md includes how to play the game (not just the game on the computer, but also the actual game), though both PROPOSAL and README still have to be finished (proposal just to have more specifications). 

**30 minutes:** Added skeleton (bridge.h file), though this might greatly be modified. More .h files and certainly more functions will need to be created. 

### 2025-01-07 - Rules, FLOWCHART.md, editing README.md and DEVLOG.md.

**40 minutes:** Clarifying rules of the game, appending them in the README.md. Created a FLOWCHART.md to help with organization and to get a more specific flow of the game than would be offered in either the PROPOSAL or README (for personal use). 

### 2025-01-08 - Added files, changes to bridge.c and bridge.h

**40 minutes:** bridge.c and bridge.h skeleton structure changed to include more functions. Also, added more <.h> files relating to the project, and fixed bugs (ex. having stdin.h instead of stdio.h).
