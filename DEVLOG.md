### 2024-01-06 - Basic files, skeleton

**~35 minutes:** Editing README.md, DEVLOG.md, and PROPOSAL.md. README.md includes how to play the game (not just the game on the computer, but also the actual game), though both PROPOSAL and README still have to be finished (proposal just to have more specifications). 

**minutes:** Added skeleton (bridge.h file), though this might greatly be modified.

**40 minutes:** Clarifying rules of the game, writing them in the README.md.
