### A basic, written flowchart of how the code will run.

When a user compiles and runs the code, they join the queue. 4 players must join the queue before the game can start. While there are insufficient players, a message displaying that there are insufficient players is on screen as well as how many more players are required. 

SETUP phase: ONE player is chosen at random to be the initial dealer. 4 players are randomly put into GROUPS OF TWO. All players are given a USER NUMBER so it is clear whose turn it is (these USER NUMBERS) will be displayed so that we know who is currently going). 13 cards are randomly assigned to players with no repetition. A total points variable will be set up, starting at 0. 

BIDDING phase: The player who is assigned to be dealer makes the first call.
