# Bridging Connections

### Hive Mind

### Project Description:

Introducing, Bridge: a 2v2 card game that might require a few playthroughs to fully understand. Shown to me by a fellow math team student on the way to PClassic, I decided it would be a brilliant idea to code a game with a million conditions in C, applying the knowledge we've learned in the semester of this class.
  
### Instructions:

**Vocabulary:** If you are someone like me, you may not be the most familiar with card game vocabulary. Thus, here are a few that are important for Bridge.

- *Trick*: A round where each player takes turns placing a card on the table, and the card with the highest value (determined by rules of the game) wins.
- *Trump* (or *trump card*): A card or suit (most typically suit) that ranks the highest in a game (see metaphor: I've just played my trump card). 
- *Call*: Either a pass, bid, double, or redouble. 
- *Declarer*: Player of the pair who first mentions the suit or notrump that becomes the final contract.
- *Dummy*: The declarerâ€™s partner. They must show all 13 of their cards face-up. 

**How to Play/Interaction:** (To be clear, this is a simplified version of Bridge. Yes, simplified.) The suits in order of progression are alphabetical: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades. The card rankings are: 1,2,...,10, jack, king, queen, ace. For simplicity's sake, the teams will be randomized. 

Each player receives an equal number of cards (so, 13) from the dealer, which is a randomized individual from the group of 4. There is then a set order: the dealer appears on top, and everyone else is considered next in line clockwise. 

If everyone passes in the first rotation, the next (clockwise; in this case, decided by join date[?]) dealer will deal out a new hand. A rotation ends when 3 successive players declare a pass.
