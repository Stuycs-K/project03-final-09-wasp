# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Patrick Was
       
# Intentions:

Introducing, Bridge: a card game that might require a few re-explanations to understand. Introduced to me by a fellow math team student on the way to PClassic, 

This project is meant to reinforce using pipes (perhaps sockets, if time allows; would require some changing and reorganizing) for multiplayer/LAN gaming through a card game. It will use semaphores and shared memory so that players have to wait for their turn and to update card values. 
    
# Intended usage:

A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface).
  
# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.
     
How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.
  
What data structures you will be using and how.
     
What algorithms and /or data structures you will be using, and how.
    
# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project.
